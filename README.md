### Base URL
Use the following base URL for all API requests:

```plaintext
https://api.opportify.ai/insights/v1/<service>/<endpoint>
```

## Requirements

Requires PHP [v8.1 or later](https://www.php.net/releases). 

## Getting Started

First, install Opportify via the Composer package manager:

```shell
composer require opportify/opportify-sdk-php
```

### Calling Email Insights

```php
use Opportify\Sdk\EmailInsights;

$emailInsights = new EmailInsights("YOUR-API-KEY-HERE");

$params = [
    "email" => "test@gmial.com", // *gmial* - just an example to be auto-corrected
    "enableAi" => true,
    "enableAutoCorrection" => true
];

$result = $emailInsights->analyze($params);
```

### Calling IP Insights

```php
use Opportify\Sdk\IpInsights;

$ipInsights = new IpInsights("<YOUR-KEY-HERE>");

$params = [
    "ip" => "3.1.122.82",
    "enableAi" => true
];

$result = $ipInsights->analyze($params);
```

### Enabling Debug Mode

```php
$clientInsights->setDebugMode(true);
```

### Handling Error

We strongly recommend that any usage of this SDK happens within a try-catch to properly handle any exceptions or errors.

```php
use OpenAPI\Client\ApiException;

try {
    
    // Email or IP Insights usage...

} catch (ApiException $e) {
    throw new \Exception($e->getResponseBody());
}
```
Below are the `ApiException` functions available:

| Function | Type | Value Sample |
|------------|------|--------------|
| `$e->getMessage();` | string | `"[403] Client error: POST https://api.opportify.ai/insights/v1/... resulted in a 403 Forbidden"` |
| `$e->getResponseBody();` | string | `"{"errorMessage":"Your plan does not support AI features, please upgrade your plan or set enableAI as false.","errorCode":"INVALID_PLAN"}"` |
| `$e->getCode();` | integer | `403` |
